"""
Determine the Compound Annual Growth Rate for an investment
"""

# Declare a variable beginning_balance as a float


# Declare a variable ending_balance as float


# Declare a variable years as an float


# Define a function called calculate_compound_growth_rate with three arguments: beginning_balance, ending_balance, years. Function should output growth_rate.





# Call calculate_compound_growth_rate using beginning_balance, ending_balance, and years. Capture as year_one_growth.



# Update beginning_balance and ending balance for year two, and then execute calculate_compound_growth_rate




# Call calculate_compound_growth_rate using beginning_balance, ending_balance, and years. Capture as year_two_growth.


# Update beginning_balance and ending balance for year three, and then execute calculate_compound_growth_rate



# Call calculate_compound_growth_rate using beginning_balance, ending_balance, and years. Capture as year_three_growth.



# Use Python round() function to round year_one_growth, year_two_growth, and year_three_growth. Capture these as new variables.



# Print year_one_growth, year_two_growth, year_three_growth as percents using string formatting


# Challenge

# Create a global, empty list


# Define a function called


    # Populate growth_rates list using add() function


# Call calculate_compound_growth_rate_list and populate growth_rates with 2016 values (beginning_balance and ending_balance)



# Call calculate_compound_growth_rate_list and populate growth_rates with 2017 values (beginning_balance and ending_balance)



# Call calculate_compound_growth_rate_list and populate growth_rates with 2018 values (beginning_balance and ending_balance)



# Print growth_rates list
